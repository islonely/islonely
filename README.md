## How can I get to heaven?
If you're reading this today it could be because you have loved ones in your life that love and cherish you enough to spend time each day praying for you. How detrimental it is to a mother who truly believes a child they wholly love is on their way to the lake of fire. If not because I love and care about you, please read this for that someone in your life that loves you.

Here's a song about that: [Someone](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AorXoHIFh1NNmvEue75OW0Wr-Lxf_Q?e=3fOHgi)
### Realize that you have sinned against God.
> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
>
> **Romans 3:10**

> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
>
> **Romans 3:23**

> For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
>
> **Romans 6:23**

> Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
>
> **Romans 5:12,20**
### Humble yourself; let go of your ego.
> But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
>
> **James 4:6**

> Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
>
> **1 Peter 5:5**

### Know that Jesus loves *you* and died for you because of that love.
 > For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
>
> **Romans 5:6,8**

> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
>
> **John 3:16-17**

> Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
>
> **John 15:13**

> Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.
>
> **1 Peter 2:24**

> For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
>
> **Hebrews 9:26**

> Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
>
> **2 Corinthians 5:20-21**

### By the shedding of His blood, you can be redeemed.
> Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
>
> **Hebrews 9:12,22**

> In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
>
> **Ephesians 1:7**

> Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:
>
> **1 Peter 1:18-19**

### Call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
> Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
>
> **Titus 3:5**

> For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.
>
> **Ephesians 2:8-9**

> And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
>
> **Romans 11:16**
  
> And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
>
> **Acts 16:30-31**
  
> that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto the righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. **For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.** How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
>
> **Romans 10:9-13**

### What now?
Praise the Lord! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me. Some people will teach that you can lose your salvation by choosing to reject Jesus after you have been saved. The Bible teaches otherwise. Imagine an envelope that's sealed with a wax seal in ye olden days. The only way to open that envelope would be by breaking the seal or breaking the envelope. The Bible says we're sealed by the Holy Spirit. To put it bluntly: if you think you have he power to break the seal that is the Holy Spirit, then you are delusional. We can destroy the body which would be comparable to the envelope. But our soul, the letter inside, remains perfectly in tact.
> In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
>
> **Ephesians 1:13**

Some will also say that if you sin too much as a Christian, then you can lose your salvation that way. The Bible tells us that there is no sacrifice for our sins even if we continue to sin after that we have been saved. Jesus' sacrifice for us covered all sin, past, present, and future.
> For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
>
> **Hebrews 10:26**

> But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:
>
> **Romans 5:20b**

That is not to say that a Christian should sin. In follow up to Romans 5:20, Paul also wrote:
> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
>
> **Romans 6:1-2**
